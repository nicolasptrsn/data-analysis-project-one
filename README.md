# My first Techdegree Project for Data Analysis

Hi there, and welcome! 

I've built a console number guessing game using Python that prompts a player to choose a number between a specified range of numbers. 
In this game, the computer is "thinking" of a number between 1 and 100.
After the player guesses the correct number, he/she/they will see the number of attempts it took them to guess correctly displayed in the console, as well as the mean, median, and mode of the high scores. 
Think you can guess the number?
